# Shopping Assistant System

This is a Java-based project implementing a Shopping Assistant System. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts by modeling various classes such as `ShoppingAssistant`, `PlaceOrder`, `Payment`, and `StoreDatabase` that work together to simulate a shopping system.

## Features
- **Shopping Assistant**: Assists users with shopping and provides personalized recommendations.
- **Place Order**: Handles order placement, payment initiation, updates to order details, and cancellation.
- **Payment**: Processes payments, generates receipts, and handles refunds.
- **Store Database**: Simulates a simple storage system for storing, fetching, updating, and deleting data.

## File Structure
- `ShoppingAssistant.java`
- `PlaceOrder.java`
- `Payment.java`
