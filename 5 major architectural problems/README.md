# Architectural Challenges in Software: Real Problems and Smart Solutions

## Overview

This project examines architectural challenges faced by major software systems and the solutions implemented to address them. The focus is on improving scalability, reliability, and performance, aligning with key Software Design and Architecture (SDA) principles.

### Case Study: Twitter's Scalability Crisis (2010)

**Problem:**  
Twitter faced scalability issues in 2010 due to its monolithic architecture, causing frequent crashes during high-traffic events.

**Solution:**  
- **Microservices Architecture:** Twitter transitioned from a monolithic system to smaller, independent services, allowing for more efficient scaling.
- **Distributed Databases & Caching:** Improved database management and implemented caching (e.g., Redis) to enhance performance.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Tools like Apache Kafka were integrated to handle real-time data streams and updates efficiently.
- **Scaling Infrastructure:** Added more servers to distribute the load instead of relying on larger servers.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Set up monitoring systems to identify and fix issues proactively.

### How to Implement This Solution
1. Break down the system into microservices.
2. Use distributed databases to scale efficiently.
3. Implement caching to improve response times.
4. Use real-time data processing tools like Apache Kafka.
5. Continuously monitor performance.

## Conclusion

By adopting microservices, distributed systems, and real-time processing, Twitter solved its scalability problem and set a foundation for future growth. This case highlights the importance of modern architectural principles in building scalable and reliable systems.
