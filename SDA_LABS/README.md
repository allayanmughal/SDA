# Observer Pattern and Event Management System

This project implements the Observer design pattern along with an Event Management system in Java. It demonstrates how to use observers to react to state changes in a subject and how to manage events in a modular way.

## Features

- **Observer Pattern**: Implements a simple Observer pattern with various observers (Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal) that respond to state changes in a subject.
- **Event Management System**: An event manager that allows listeners to subscribe and unsubscribe to different events (like open and save).
- **Multiple Event Listeners**: Supports multiple listeners for different events, including SMS, email notifications, and logging operations.
